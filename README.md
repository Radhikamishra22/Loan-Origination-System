Loan Origination System (Java)
📌 Project Overview

The Loan Origination System is a Java-based application designed to automate and manage the end-to-end process of loan application handling. The system validates customer details, performs deduplication checks, calculates EMI plans, and evaluates loan eligibility using predefined scoring rules. The project demonstrates the practical use of object-oriented programming concepts and modular design.
